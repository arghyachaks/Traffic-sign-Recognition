# Traffic-sign-Recognition
I am using the Belgian Traffic sign Dataset.Go to http://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/ and download the training and test data.There
is a lot of datasets on that page, but you only need the two files listed under BelgiumTS for Classification (cropped images)":
BelgiumTSC_Training (171.3MBytes)
BelgiumTSC_Testing (76.5MBytes)
